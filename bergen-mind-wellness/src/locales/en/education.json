        "p2": "PTSD is not a sign of weakness—it's a normal response to abnormal and overwhelming circumstances. The brain's natural stress response becomes disrupted after trauma, leading to persistent symptoms that interfere with daily life. With proper treatment, recovery is possible, and many people with PTSD go on to heal and thrive."
